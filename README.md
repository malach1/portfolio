# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio, a curated collection of innovative apps I've designed and developed for learning and showcasing my skills. Take a glimpse at the animated GIF above for a high-level overview, and by clicking on the video links to experience each app in stunning high-definition version. This portfolio showcases my creative vision, technical expertise, and passion for building engaging digital experiences.<br><br>

**CLONE APPS**

By recreating popular production apps, you'll gain hands-on experience with cutting-edge features and design principles that drive real-world success. Explore my collection of clones, where I've applied my skills to build functional replicas of industry-leading apps.

* Netflix Clone
  
I recently built two identical Netflix-inspired apps, one using UIKit and the other using SwiftUI. The goal was to compare the two approaches and learn the techniques for creating layouts. My findings suggest that SwiftUI allows for faster development and iteration, making it a more efficient choice for building apps. With SwiftUI, I was able to quickly create and refine my app's layout, whereas the UIKit version required more time and effort to achieve the same result..<br><br>

**FEATURES**

I'm fascinated by media features, and I built this app to gain hands-on experience with the AVFoundation libraries, specifically AVPlayer, to learn the components of building a video playback feature. One of the most intriguing aspects I wanted to explore was the ability to drag and view thumbnails, which allowed me to delve deeper into the app's functionality and user experience..<br><br>

**SIDE PROJECTS**

* map!t
  
As a resident of Japan, I've had the pleasure of hosting friends from around the world who visit me in this beautiful country. One question I consistently get asked is, "What are the must-see places in Japan?" To help answer this question and share my knowledge with others, I created an app that provides personalized recommendations for exploring Japan. You can download the app from the App Store by clicking this link: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/map-t/id1661926458">https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/map-t/id1661926458</a><br><br>

* Alicia AI
  
Generative AI is an interesting phenomenon and I am doing research in the Applied Generative AI space.  I built Alicia AI as a language learning chatbot with features to help you study.<br><br>
