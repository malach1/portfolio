**CLONE APPS**

Building production clones is a great way to learn great features and design that is performing well in production.  Here are some clones that I am able to copy, learn, and build.

I created two Netflix clone.  The left uses UIKit and the right uses SwiftUI.
The goal was to learn the techniques of the layouts and my findings is you can build and iterate faster with SwiftUI.<br><br>

**FEATURES**

Media is interesting to me and this app was built to learn the components of building a video play with AVFoundation libraries such as AVPlayer.
Dragging and seeing thumbnails was the interesting feature I wanted to learn.<br><br>
